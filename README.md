# 𝗨𝗥𝗟 𝗦𝗛𝗢𝗥𝗧𝗡𝗘𝗥


This project implements a robust URL shortener backend API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Postman for testing. It empowers users to create concise and shareable links for long URLs.


## Key Features
This project follows a modular structure, promoting maintainability and scalability. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

* 𝗨𝗥𝗟 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Shorten lengthy URLs into more manageable and visually appealing formats.
* 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲𝘀 (𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹):  Enable users to personalize shortcodes (within reasonable constraints) for a branded experience.
* 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Seamlessly redirect users to the original URL when they access the shortened link.
* 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 (𝗶𝗳 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱): Store shortened URLs and their corresponding originals in MongoDB for long-term accessibility.
* 𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid URLs or unexpected scenarios. (Provide details on specific errors handled)
* 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: Address potential security concerns, such as URL validation to prevent malicious links and rate limiting to control shortening requests. (Outline specific measures taken)
* 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝗶𝗳 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱): Utilize Postman or other testing tools to ensure the functionality of the API endpoints. (Specify the testing approach)
